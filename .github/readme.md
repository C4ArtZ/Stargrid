## FAQ ðŸ¤”

### How do I add my own icons?
Just add them to "Stargrid/icons/links/". Now add the filename + extension to your settings.js file.<br/>
In my case I used the 48x48px icons from [materialdesignicons.com](https://materialdesignicons.com/) or made my own.<br/>
Different resolutions might look strange. I am working on a fix for this.

### How do I add a background?
Place your desired images inside the "Stargrid/wallpaper/" folder.<br/>
Now reference them inside your settings.js. Remember to include the extension (.jpg / .png / etc.).

### Can you add feature xyz?
Maybe. You can let me know by submitting a feature request via the "Issues" tab.

### I don't need 12 links. / I need more than 12!
At the moment there are always 12 links. I am working on a way to make this dynamic.<br/>
In the meantime you can just have less than 12 elements in your links / icons inside the settings.js file.<br/>
This might however lead to some strange behavior in the future.
