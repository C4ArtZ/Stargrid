## FAQ

### Can I add my own icons?
Sure! Just make sure they have a resolution of 48x48px and save them to Startgrid/icons/links/.<br/>
You can now edit your setting.js file to use the correct file.

### How do I change the background?
You can replace the files inside Startgrid/wallpaper/ with any image you like.<br/>
Just make sure to name them "day.png", "night.png", "sunrise.png" and "sunset.png".

### Can you add feature xyz?
Maybe. You can let me know by submitting a feature request via the "Issues" tab.

### I don't need 12 links. / I need more than 12!
At the moment there are always 12 links. I am working on a way to make this dynamic.<br/>
In the meantime you can just have less than 12 elements in your links / icons inside the settings.js file.<br/>
This might however lead to some strange behavior in the future.

### When does the wallpaper change?
07:00 - 10:59 : sunrise.png<br/>
11:00 - 16:59 : day.png<br/>
17:00 - 20:59 : sunset<br/>
